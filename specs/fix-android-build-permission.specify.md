# Specification

## Requirements

**Goal**: Fix the `git commit` failure caused by the missing `app_hide.toml` permission file in the Tauri Android build process.

**Context**:
- The user attempted to commit changes (`git commit -m "feat: mcp 설치"`).
- The pre-commit hook (or build script) failed with: `permissions: failed to read file ...\autogenerated\commands\app_hide.toml': 지정된 경로를 찾을 수 없습니다. (os error 3)`.
- This suggests a mismatch between expected and actual generated permission files.
- `apps/mobile/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` only lists `core:default` and `opener:default`.

**Requirements**:
1.  **Clean & Regenerate**: The most likely cause is stale build artifacts. The plan must include cleaning `src-tauri/gen` and `src-tauri/target`.
2.  **Verify**: Ensure `git commit` works after cleaning.
3.  **Fallback**: If cleaning doesn't work, investigate adding `app:hide` permission explicitly or checking `tauri-plugin` configuration.
4.  **Workflow**: Follow Spec-Kit process (Spec -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implement).
