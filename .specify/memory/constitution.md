# z-project Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Principled AI-Assisted Development
To counteract the limitations of generic LLMs, the AI must adhere to a predefined, version-controlled set of coding methodologies, style guides, and architectural rules. These rules form this constitution, which governs all code generation and modification, eliminating the need for repetitive, per-request instructions.

### 2. Composable Project Specifications
Project context is not monolithic. The AI's understanding must be assembled from modular, reusable components (e.g., tech stack, domain, design system, project-specific libraries). This compositional approach allows the AI to dynamically adapt its behavior to any project's unique requirements.

### 3. Automated & Verifiable Workflows
All development activities, from feature implementation to verification, must be encapsulated in automated, repeatable workflows. These workflows define the standard operating procedures for the AI, ensuring consistency, reliability, and enabling a fully autonomous development process.

### 4. Structured & Process-Oriented Task Execution
Achieving production-level quality requires more than simple prompts. The AI must follow a structured, multi-step process for every task. This includes integrating Mission-Critical Prompts (MCPs) and other necessary tools to ensure a rigorous and well-documented development cycle.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, review, and an approved migration plan. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
