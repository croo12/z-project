# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Growth-Centric Value
- **Objective**: All features must strictly contribute to the continuous growth and efficiency of frontend developers.
- **Outcome**: The platform acts as a curated partner for self-improvement.

### 2. Premium Quality Standards
- **Aesthetics**: Deliver a state-of-the-art "Wow" experience using modern design trends (Glassmorphism, rich animations).
- **Engineering**: Ensure robust, crash-free backend logic and highly responsive frontend interactions.

### 3. Living Documentation System
- **Principle**: Documentation and code are inseparable. Updates must be atomic and synchronous.
- **Practice**: Actively maintain `AGENTS.md`, spec files, and READMEs as the project evolves.

### 4. Disciplined Autonomous Workflow
- **Tools**: Strictly enforce the use of **Spec-Kit** for feature lifecycle management and **Sequential Thinking** for complex problem solving.
- **Context**: Leverage **MCP tools** (Context7) to bridge knowledge gaps before implementation.

### 5. Clear Communication Protocol
- **Language**: Use **Korean** for Implementation Plans and PR/User communication to ensure precise alignment.
- **Clarity**: Prioritize clarity in code comments and technical documentation.

### 6. Testing
- **Rule**: 이건 테스트 용입니다
