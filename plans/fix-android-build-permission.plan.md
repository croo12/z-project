# IMPL_PLAN: Fix Android Build Permission Error

## Technical Context
- **Problem**: `git commit` fails in pre-commit hook due to missing `app_hide.toml` in `src-tauri/gen/android/...` (or similar autogenerated path).
- **Cause**: Stale build artifacts or desynchronized `capabilities` generation.
- **Constraints**: Must follow Spec-Kit workflow.

## Constitution Check
- [x] **Growth-Centric**: Fixing the build enables further development.
- [x] **Premium Quality**: Ensuring build stability is foundational for engineering quality.
- [x] **Disciplined Workflow**: Using Spec-Kit artifacts for this fix.

## Phase 0: Research
- **Analysis**: The error `app_hide.toml` not found indicates a mismatch between what the build system expects and what exists. `tauri.conf.json` does not explicitly reference `app:hide`.
- **Decision**: Clean build artifacts and force regeneration.

## Phase 1: Design
- **Action**: 
    1. Clean `apps/mobile/src-tauri/target` and `apps/mobile/src-tauri/gen`.
    2. Run `tauri android build` to trigger capability generation.
    3. Verify `git commit` succeeds.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- **Files**: None to create (only cleaning and regenerating).
- **Verification**: `git commit` success.
